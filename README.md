# Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Learning Projects** repository! This repository contains various blockchain and Web3 projects built as part of my learning journey in Solidity, Hardhat, and smart contract development.

## Structure
Each project is organized into its own folder within this repository. This structure helps keep projects separate and manageable.

### Current Projects:
- **NFT Project**: A simple NFT smart contract with minting, approval, and transfer functionality.
- *(More projects will be added as I continue learning and building.)*

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment.
- **Mocha & Chai**: For writing and running tests.
- **JavaScript**: For interacting with smart contracts.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and project management.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Achraf012/learning-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd learning-projects/<project-folder>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
6. Deploy the contract (customize the script if needed):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

## Future Plans
- Implementing more complex smart contracts.
- Exploring decentralized applications (DApps).
- Adding marketplace, staking, and other Web3 functionalities.

Stay tuned for more updates! ðŸš€
