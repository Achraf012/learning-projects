# Low Issues

## L-1: Literal Instead of Constant

Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals. If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

## L-2: Internal Function Used Only Once

Instead of separating the logic into a separate function, consider inlining the logic into the calling function. This can reduce the number of function calls and improve readability.
